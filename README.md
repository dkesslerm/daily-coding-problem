# Daily Coding Problem
Simple repository that hosts my solutions to problems from [Daily Coding Problem](https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/).

I plan on using this repo primarily for practice, revision, and to track progress.

**Note**: The file *dailyCodingProblem.cpp* holds all solutions to the problems only, with no extra info about the problem itself. Any other file *DD_MM_YYYY.cpp* holds info about the problem sent on that day and its corresponding solution.

**Note 2**: I'm planning on changing this README in order to make it easier to navigate through the repo. Right now it's a bit of a pain having to go through each individual file to know what it's about. It would be nice to group different problems based on different topics. I'll look into it all!
